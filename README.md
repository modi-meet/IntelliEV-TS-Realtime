# IntelliEV 🚑⚡
**Next-Gen Emergency Response & EV Management System**

IntelliEV is a dual-interface platform designed to bridge the gap between Electric Vehicle (EV) users and Emergency Response teams. It leverages real-time data, AI-driven analysis, and smart mapping to ensure safety on the roads and rapid response during critical incidents.

---

## 🌟 Overview

Imagine a system where your car detects an accident and instantly notifies the nearest ambulance, while simultaneously creating a "Green Corridor" for emergency vehicles. That's IntelliEV.

We provide two distinct experiences:
1.  **For EV Users:** A smart dashboard for navigation, hazard reporting, and community alerts.
2.  **For Emergency Responders:** A command center to track fleet status, receive SOS alerts, and dispatch units efficiently using AI suggestions.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🚗 EV User Dashboard
*   **Live Map Navigation:** Locate charging stations, view traffic signals, and see nearby EVs.
*   **Smart Hazard Reporting:** Report accidents or road hazards. Our AI analyzes the severity automatically.
*   **One-Touch SOS:** Trigger an emergency alert manually or let the system detect high-impact events.
*   **Community Feed:** Real-time updates on road conditions from other users.

### 🚨 Emergency Responder Dashboard
*   **Real-Time Incident Tracking:** See SOS alerts pop up instantly on the map with severity levels.
*   **AI Dispatch Logic:** The system suggests the *best* ambulance based on proximity and incident severity.
*   **Fleet Management:** Track ambulance locations and status (Available, En-route, Busy).
*   **Green Corridor Simulation:** Visualize routes for emergency vehicles.
*   **Simulation Tools:** Built-in tools to simulate SOS calls and ambulance movements for testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Maps:** Leaflet & React-Leaflet
*   **Backend / Database:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database)
*   **Routing:** Leaflet Routing Machine

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
